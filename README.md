# stock-analysis


## Overview of Project


### Purpose
This purpose of this project is to analyze stock data from twelve different companies to see their total daily volume and yearly returns from 2017 and 2018. It is also an exercise in comparing two different ways of coding for the same solution

## Analysis

### Overview of Original Code


### Overview of Refactored Code


## Results
There are the images of the [2017 Stock Data](Resources/VBA_Challenge_2017.png) and the [2018 Stock Data](Resources/VBA_Challenge_2018.png).

Looking at the two years side by side, there may not actually be a correlation between the Total Daily Volume, or amount that a stock has been traded, and the yearly return. It was hypothesized that a higher Daily Volume would correlate to a higher Yearly Return. However, nearly half the stocks -- DQ, HASI, SEDG, TERP, and VLSR -- had an increase in Total Daily Volume fro m 2017 tp 2018, but a significant decrease in the Yearly Return.


## Summary

- Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code


- Advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script
The refactored code is certainly more efficient in calculating
