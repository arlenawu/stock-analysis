# stock-analysis


## Overview of Project
This project analyzes stock market data from twelve companies -- AY, CSIQ, DQ, ENPH, FSLR, HASI, JKS, RUN, SEDG, SPWR, TERP, and VSLR -- to find their Total Daily Volume and Yearly Returns for the years 2017 and 2018.

### Purpose
This purpose of this project is to see if there is any correlation between a stock's Total Daily Volumes and its Yearly Return, and whether or not a stocks Daily Volume is a good metric to use in predicting the profit of a stock. This project is also an exercise in comparing two different ways of coding for the same solution.

## Analysis

### Overview of Original Code


### Overview of Refactored Code


## Results
These are the tables of the [2017 Stock Data](Resources/VBA_Challenge_2017.png) and the [2018 Stock Data](Resources/VBA_Challenge_2018.png), which show the Total Daily Volume and the Yearly Return for each of the 12 stocks.

It was hypothesized that a higher Daily Volume would correlate to a higher Yearly Return, however, looking at the two years side by side, there does not appear be any strong correlation between the Total Daily Volume and the yearly return. From the years 2017 to 2018, nearly half the stocks -- DQ, HASI, SEDG, TERP, and VLSR -- had an increase in Total Daily Volume, but a significant decrease in the Yearly Return. Even within the same year, Total Daily Volume does not reflect how high the Yearly Return might be.


## Summary

- Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code


- Advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script
The refactored code is certainly more efficient in calculating
